          <img src="plastic.jpg" style="margin-top:10px;margin-left: 120px;float:left;margin-right: 30px;width:400px;height: 300px;">
          <p style="color: white;">Nilgiris, one of the most sought after hill stations in India, is fast marching toward its goal of becoming a plastic-free zone. This iconic hill destination in Tamil Nadu attracts lakhs of visitors every year, thereby attracting tons of plastic litter as well. The need of the hour is to encourage people for responsible tourism, which means such a measure will not only benefit the place, but will also help people in the long run. The Nilgiris District Administration has already banned the sale of single-use plastic, such as soft drinks and food items packed in plastic wrappers, plastic water bottles.  This ban is applicable throughout the District of The Nilgiris. The district administration has also banned single-use plastic items beyond the entry points of the Nilgiris, such as Kunjapanai(Kotagiri), Burliar, Pattavayal, Thalur, Nadugani, Nambiar, Solladi, Kakkanallah, and Geddai. Most interestingly, visitors will also not be allowed to take any banned plastic items along with them. Interestingly, The Nilgiris was the first district in Tamil Nadu to introduce this plastic ban.</p><br>

          <p>The water ATMs were first installed on the sides of the state and national highways in the district in 70 places in the district. The Ooty municipality have 10 ATMs, the Coonoor has 4 ATMs, Gudalur has 6 ATMs, Nelakottai has 4 and so on. The ATMs are installed at the frequently crowded places in the 11 taluks of the district. The District Tourism Board installed ATMs at Dodabetta peak, Ooty Boat House and Pykara Boat House, while the Government Horticultural Department has installed the same at Government Botanical Gardens Ooty, Government Rose Garden, Sims Park in Coonoor, Kotagiri and Katteri Park among others.</p>
          <p> These ATMs charge Rs.5 for one liter of pure drinking water. Plastic products are major contaminants and pollution creators for the natural beauty and flora and fauna of Nilgiris, particularly plastic water bottles. This ban and installation of water dispensers is a good move to remove some of the pollution. The Nilgiris residents also welcomed the environmental friendly move to eradicate plastics in the district. </p><br>
